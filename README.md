###Warning

---

The slash line at the end of URL is **NECESSARY**! 

Which means your URL in WebSocket should be something like **this**: 

https://yorushika.gitlab.io/ACT.WebSocket.Template.MopiMopi?***/***HOST_PORT=ws://127.0.0.1:10501/

Instead of:

https://yorushika.gitlab.io/ACT.WebSocket.Template.MopiMopi?HOST_PORT=ws://127.0.0.1:10501/

*(Don't just copy the URLs above into your path directly! You may need to adjust the IP address and port to your own!)*
